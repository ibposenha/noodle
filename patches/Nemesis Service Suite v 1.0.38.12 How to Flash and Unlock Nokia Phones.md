One of the most useful features of NSS is the Virtual USB Device (VUD) mode, which enables direct communication with any BB5 phone via DKU-2 USB cable. This mode allows users to update the firmware to the required region, read the phone block code, and retrieve the original product code and warranty data from the NSS server. VUD mode also supports faster flashing by using the phone RX2 line.
 
NSS is a free download for personal use and it is constantly updated to support the latest Nokia phones and flash loaders. The latest version of NSS is 1.0.38.15, which was released on 23 June 2009. This version added support for Windows 7 and for the latest Nokia BB5 phones via USB. The previous version of NSS was 1.0.38.12, which was released on 13 July 2007. This version added support for BB5 phone RX2 line, flash loaders pack 7.16, and some bug fixes.

Nemesis Service Suite can be used for various purposes, depending on the user's needs and preferences. Here are some of the common uses of NSS and how to perform them:
 
### How to Change the Product Code of a Nokia Phone
 
The product code of a Nokia phone determines the firmware version and the language pack that are installed on the phone. Changing the product code can allow users to update their phones to the latest firmware or to a different region or language. To change the product code of a Nokia phone using NSS, follow these steps[^1^]:
 
1. Connect your phone and wait for Windows to install the drivers.
2. Open Nemesis Service Suite and click âScan for new deviceâ on the right-upper part of the window.
3. Click on the icon âPhone infoâ.
4. Click on âScanâ.
5. Change the product code to the one you want from a list of available codes. You can find some product codes online or use a tool like Nokia Product Code Viewer.
6. Mark the case âEnableâ.
7. Press âWriteâ, and your phoneâs product code will be changed. You might think that nothing happened, because the phone is still in normal mode, and the changing of the product code only takes a couple of seconds, but donât worry, the product code changed.
8. Close Nemesis Service Suite and run the Nokia Software Update or Nokia Care Suite to update your phone's firmware.
9. Make sure not to touch the cable or the phone while your phone is updating or else you will break it.
10. Thatâs it! When you restart your phone, it should now be updated with the new product code.

### How to Unlock the Security Code of a Nokia Phone
 
The security code of a Nokia phone is a four-digit or five-digit code that protects the phone from unauthorized access. If you forget your security code or enter it incorrectly three times, you will be locked out of your phone. To unlock the security code of a Nokia phone using NSS, follow these steps[^2^]:

1. Connect your phone and wait for Windows to install the drivers.
2. Open Nemesis Service Suite and click âScan for new deviceâ on the right-upper part of the window.
3. Click on the icon âPhone infoâ.

6. Click on âToolsâ and then âFactory settingsâ.
7. Select âFull factoryâ and press âResetâ. Your phone's security code will be reset to 12345.
8. Close Nemesis Service Suite and restart your phone. You should now be able to access your phone with the default security code 12345.

### How to Reset the Life Timer of a Nokia Phone
